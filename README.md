# Competitive_Programming
Some solutions for programming competitive problems, mainly CodeForces.<br>
The solutions are in the <i>solved</i> folder, the first line of each file has a link to the problem.

Makefile Guide:

Compile: make c (or just: make)

Execute: make e

Execute and put output on ap.txt file: make ef (do this will delete last ap.txt file).

New File, with unsolved main.cpp: make n (the unsolved problem goes to waiting folder with the number of the last file.)

New File, with solved main.cpp: make k f="{problem name}" (the solved problems goes to Solved folder with the name given by you).


TODO:
- [ ] Order problems by Tags.
- [ ] Add link reference to all problems.
