## XOR
- A XOR B = C => C XOR A = B
- - (PARTIAL XOR) XOR (MISSING ELEMENT) = (TOTAL XOR) => (TOTAL XOR) XOR (PATIAL XOR) = (MISSING ELEMNT)

# Learning Problems:
https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1547/E - ANS[i] = min(DP[L], DP[R]) // Divide a DP in Left and Right and take the best solutions.

https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1673/B - Think about periods in substring problems. And think about look for a shorter substring first.
